Mike Tyson (played by Kenan Thompson) broke down his defense strategy ahead of the first post-slap Oscars in a “Saturday Night Live” spoof of an Access Hollywood red carpet show. The show’s cold open poked fun at several Oscar-nominated stars including “Everything Everywhere All At Once” actor Jamie Lee Curtis along with “The Banshees of Inisherin” actors Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. The Access Hollywood hosts (played by Heidi Gardner and Andrew Dismukes) brought in their first guest ― Tyson ― who stated he’d handle security “judicially and expeditiously” in the wake of Will Smith’s slap of presenter Chris Rock last year. One of the hosts ― Mario Lopez (played by Dismukes) ― quizzed Thompson on whether there are new security measures following the slap heard ’round the world. “Thank you for that question, Mario Luigi. This year all the nominees have been given tasers, all the seat fillers have been given guns and [host] Jimmy Kimmel has been given a flamethrower,” he answered. He later added that the Oscars is taking the possible threat of a second attack by Smith “very seriously.” “Luckily we were able to slip one of those Apple AirTags into Will Smith’s pocket, so we know exactly where he’ll be at all times ― unless, of course, he changes his pants and then he can be anywhere, so stay frosty everybody,” Thompson said. You can watch more of the “SNL” cold open ― which includes George Santos (played by Bowen Yang) pretending to be Tom Cruise ― below.
