Two-time Super Bowl champ Travis Kelce is set to be a first-time “Saturday Night Live” guest host this weekend. (Watch the video below.) If it’s adventure he’s after, he’s already succeeded. The Kansas City tight end, who caught a touchdown pass in the Chiefs’ victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in the big game last month, channeled Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones for an “SNL” promo shared Wednesday. In a goofy tweak of an early scene from 1981′s “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” Kelce snatches an “SNL” logo off a pedestal and replaces it with the Lombardi Trophy. “So shiny,” says Marcello Hernandez, playing the part of Alfred Molina’s Satipo. “Can I touch it?” But before the two can make a getaway, all hell breaks loose in the show’s studio and it’s time to run. It’s also time for funny commentary from “SNL” castmates Bowen Yang and Ego Nwodim.
