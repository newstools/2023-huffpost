Jenna Ellis, an ex-lawyer for former President Donald Trump, was censured by Colorado’s chief disciplinary judge on Wednesday for misconduct after spreading bogus claims about the 2020 presidential election. Ellis agreed that several claims she made about the election were “misrepresentations,” Colorado Newsline first reported. Ellis, once a Trump critic who later joined his legal team, made false claims that the election was “stolen” from Trump and the outcome of the election was “actually fraudulent.” Her state-imposed punishment is essentially a public admonishment. Ellis late Wednesday retweeted a Twitter post that claimed she “never admitted she lied” and that “nothing in the stipulation agreed to anything having been false, dishonest, deceptive, or intentional.” She didn’t respond to HuffPost’s inquiry. Bryon M. Large, Colorado’s state Supreme Court-appointed chief disciplinary judge, said Ellis’ misconduct caused “actual harm by undermining the American public’s confidence in the presidential election.” “The public censure in this matter reinforces that even if engaged in political speech, there is a line attorneys cannot cross, particularly when they are speaking in a representative capacity,” the state Supreme Court’s office of attorney regulation counsel said in a statement. The censure follows a complaint in May by the States United Democracy Center, which called on Colorado authorities to investigate Ellis for multiple violations “of professional rules” due to her work with the former president, according to Colorado Newsline.
