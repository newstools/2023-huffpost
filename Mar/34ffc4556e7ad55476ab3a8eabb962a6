Twitter CEO Elon Musk — who bought the platform last year for $44 billion — posted Tuesday it’s “better to talk to people than communicate via tweet.” The billionaire’s admission came amid a lengthy exchange with Twitter employee Haraldur Thorleifsson, who wanted to know if he’d been laid off. Musk, who has slashed Twitter’s staff, mocked Thorleifsson over his query. But their back-and-forth took a turn when Musk revealed he’d video called the staffer “to figure out what’s real vs what I was told.” Musk later apologized for the “misunderstanding of his situation.” The “better to talk” than tweet line stood out to critics, though, who mockingly called it the social media giant’s new mission statement.
