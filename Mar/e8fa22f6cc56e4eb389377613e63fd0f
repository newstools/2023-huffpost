Seth Meyers was astonished by one of the names Tucker Carlson called Donald Trump in a private text message. In the text to his producer, Alex Pfeiffer, on Jan. 6, 2021, Carlson allegedly said Trump was “a demonic force, a destroyer, but he’s not going to destroy us.” That detail was revealed in a court filing last month from Dominion Voting Systems, which is suing Fox News for $1.6 billion over its coverage of the 2020 election. “I don’t even think I’ve ever called Trump a demonic force. That’s worse than anything I’ve ever said about Trump,” Meyers said Wednesday on “Late Night.” Watch below on “Late Night.”
