Audrey Satchivi, a senior at Indiana University, was competing on “Jeopardy!” during the trivia show’s high school reunion tournament Tuesday when host Mayim Bialik asked her about a “quirk” she could share with the audience. “I’m kind of an old soul,” Satchivi said in a clip from the episode. “I’ve been collecting some things that are kind of obsolete now.
