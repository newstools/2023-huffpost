Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was hospitalized Wednesday evening following a fall at a Washington hotel, his spokesperson said. McConnell, 81, tripped at the hotel during a private dinner, Punchbowl News first reported, and was admitted to a hospital for treatment. His office didn’t give details or an update on the GOP leader’s condition. McConnell was at the Waldorf Astoria hotel, the Old Post Office building that was once Donald Trump’s hotel, according to Punchbowl News’ co-founder John Bresnahan. McConnell’s Republican Senate colleagues have shared their wishes for the GOP leader’s speedy recovery. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) addressed McConnell’s accident in a speech on the Senate floor, calling the Kentucky Republican a “good friend.” “This morning I offer a prayer of strength and healing for the leader and his family,” Schumer said. “I called the leader this morning and spoke briefly with his staff to extend my prayers and well wishes.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) also wished McConnell a full recovery. McConnell, who was first elected to the Senate in 1984, made history in January when he became the chamber’s longest-serving party leader in U.S. history. He is also Kentucky’s longest-serving senator. He served as majority leader from 2015 to 2021 while the GOP had control of the Senate. His current term expires in January 2027. McConnell broke his shoulder in a 2019 fall at his Kentucky home. This comes as other senators are out for health reasons. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) is receiving treatment for clinical depression after suffering a stroke last May during his Senate campaign. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is in California recovering at home after being hospitalized for a case of shingles.
