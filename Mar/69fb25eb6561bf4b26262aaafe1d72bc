If you are both a Target-lover and tech connoisseur, there’s one brand created by the mega-retailer that you’ll instantly become a fan of if you haven’t already: Heyday. Not to be confused with the skincare brand by the same name, Target’s tech brand offers an array of artsy electronics and tech accessories, bringing a much needed burst of color to the gray-and-black tech landscape. In the Heyday collection, you’ll find headphones, vibrant phone cases, eye-catching phone chargers and computer accessories you’ll be proud to show off instead of stuffing in a corner when you’re done using them. Many of the items were even created in collaboration with actual artists — including Aliyah Salmon, Diane Guzman and Jessie Lin — and feature unique designs that are sure to stand out among the rest of your tech goodies. Below, we rounded up some of the standout products from the Heyday line, but you can shop everything at Target.com. HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.
