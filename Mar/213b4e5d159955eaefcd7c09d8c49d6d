Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-Texas) upcoming book title tickled critics on Twitter. On Thursday, the Donald Trump-loving senator announced that “Unwoke: How to Defeat Cultural Marxism in America” will be released by Regnery Publishing in November. Per the promotional blurb, the 256-page book will provide “a long overdue argument against the woke takeover of education, big business, the media, and Hollywood.” But many people were puzzled by the use of the word “Unwoke,” with some asking if it didn’t just mean being asleep.
