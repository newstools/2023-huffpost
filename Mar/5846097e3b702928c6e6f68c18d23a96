Former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele tore into Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) over her “national divorce” proposal. The conspiracy theorist lawmaker, who spoke last year at a white nationalist event and is a close ally of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), says red states should split from blue ones. “She has no clue what the hell she’s talking about,” Steele said on MSNBC on Thursday. “Why do we listen to this crazy fool? Marjorie Taylor Greene, please just shut the hell up. Do us all a favor.” He called her an “embarrassment” to Republicans and the country. Steele, part of the GOP’s anti-Trump wing and a consistent critic of Greene and other extremists, cited the response of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) to Greene’s “national divorce” idea. “You know, I think Abraham Lincoln dealt with that kind of insanity,” Romney said, dismissing Greene as part of the “loony right.” “Mitt Romney said it best,” Steele said. “We fought that war. A Republican president lost his life over trying to save the union, and this fool wants to split it? So here we go. This is the kind of crazy that requires a lot of heavy thinking, because she isn’t.” See more from MSNBC’s “The 11th Hour” below:
