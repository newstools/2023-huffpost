Far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) presided over the House as speaker pro tempore on Wednesday, a development that drew fierce criticism. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) temporarily handed the gavel to Greene, a Donald Trump-devoted extremist who in recent weeks has called for a “national divorce” splitting red states and blue states. Spotlight-seeking Greene played a pivotal role in McCarthy winning his drawn-out bid for speaker. After his victory, McCarthy reportedly declared his political loyalty to Greene, saying he’d “never leave” her and would “always take care” of her. Critics shuddered at the conspiracy theory-endorsing fanatic sitting in the speaker’s chair.
