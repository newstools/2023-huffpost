Pop star Cyndi Lauper has likened Republicans who are pushing anti-LGBTQ legislation to the Nazis. “This is how Hitler started,” the longtime LGBTQ activist told ITK this week. “Just weeding everybody out, and then finally he, you know.” “I don’t think it’s a good idea with what they’re doing, but you know, you just have to keep fighting for civil rights,” the “Time After Time” singer continued. “I guess that’s the way it is in this country. Started out like that, didn’t it?” State lawmakers have put forward more nearly 390 anti-LGBTQ bills during their current legislative sessions, according to the ACLU. Lauper similarly likened Donald Trump to the Nazi German dictator Adolf Hitler in 2016 when Trump was running for president. “The things that he says are appalling to me and shocking,” Lauper said at the time of Trump, whose “Celebrity Apprentice” reality show she appeared on in 2010. “No matter what his daughter says, it has nothing to do with what that guy is selling,” she added. “That guy is selling inflammatory things that I have never in my whole entire life heard except, you know, Hitler.”
