As audiences and attendees prepare for a potential onslaught of slap jokes on Sunday night and the Oscars assembles its new crisis team, comedian Jimmy Kimmel has been branded as “unflappable and unslappable” as host of the 95th annual Academy Awards. Kimmel revealed his preparation for the Oscars, which will be held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, and said that he’s going to mention the infamous incident between Will Smith and Chris Rock. But there’s a high bar for material, as he told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview on Tuesday, because ”whatever I say about it, it’s going to have to be great, right?” “I obviously don’t want to make the whole monologue about that, but it would be ridiculous not to mention it,” he added. Kimmel, who has hosted the Oscars twice before, also revealed what he would do in case a slap incident happens again. “Well, I size them up, and, if I’m bigger than they are, I beat the shit out of them on television. And if it’s the Rock, I run,” he quipped. As far as winners go for Sunday, viewers will be on the lookout for a few major firsts. Angela Bassett made history as the first actor from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to score a nod, while Michelle Yeoh could become the first Asian woman to win Best Actress. Audiences will also see the results of some surprising Oscars snubs ― like zero women being nominated for Best Director) ― and no love for “The Woman King,” which was shut out of every category. “Everything Everywhere All At Once” is expected to sweep the award show, as the movie currently leads nominations with 11 nods. “The Banshees of Inisherin” and “All Quiet on the Western Front” are right behind “EEAAO” and tied at 9 nods each.
