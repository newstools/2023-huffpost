President Joe Biden took aim at conspiracy theorist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) for a second day in a row, telling a crowd on Wednesday that her antics will “have a lot of Republicans running our way.” The crowd laughed. “Isn’t she amazing?” he asked at a Democratic event in Baltimore, adding: “Oof!” The audience laughed some more. Then Biden noted that Greene recently blamed him for a fentanyl death that took place during Donald Trump’s presidency: Biden also played Greene for laughs on Tuesday, but used fewer words. When he mentioned her name, he made the sign of the cross. Instead of delivering a zinger, he said: “I’m gonna be good.” Greene, who spoke last year at a white nationalist event, is a close ally of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who has rewarded her loyalty with some plum committee assignments. She has lately been pushing a widely panned idea of a “national divorce” separating red states from blue ones.
