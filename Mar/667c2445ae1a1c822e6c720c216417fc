It’s not always easy to get your daily steps in — and of course, the motivation to go for a walk wanes even more if you’re dealing with foot pain. If you have foot pain or are interested in making walking more comfortable, you may be tempted to try insoles or other over-the-counter foot gadgets from the drugstore. But Dr. Patrick McEneaney, a podiatrist and owner/CEO of Northern Illinois Foot & Ankle Specialists, said you should chat with your doctor before buying. “With so many things on the market, just buying an insert or buying something over the counter, it might not be the type you need,” McEneaney told HuffPost. In addition, McEneaney said, “[I commonly see] people will wear shoes that are wrong for their foot types. Having an appropriate shoe for the activity, also having the appropriate shoe for your foot is almost even more important. It’s a good idea to get evaluated and see if there are any problems.” However, McEneaney and other podiatrists said there are some unlikely non-medical items that can make walking feel better for your feet. So, once you’ve met with a specialist and have talked about the best walking shoes for your foot, consult this list of products that we compiled based on our experts’ suggestions. They may help further alleviate any pain you’re having. HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team.
