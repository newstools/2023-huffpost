Lady Gaga has built a career out of defying expectations in music and on film, and her performance at the 2023 Oscars was no exception. The pop icon make a jaw-dropping entrance at Sunday’s ceremony in a floor-length black gown and sheer bustier by Versace. But by the time she took the stage to perform “Hold My Hand,” her Academy Award-nominated song from “Top Gun: Maverick,” she’d swapped Hollywood glamour for a casual T-shirt, ripped jeans and minimal makeup. She dedicated her performance to Tony Scott, who directed the original 1986 “Top Gun.” The British filmmaker and younger brother of Ridley Scott also directed such hits as 1993’s “True Romance” and 1998’s “Enemy of the State.” He died in 2012 at the age of 68. Gaga’s stripped-down approach was a marked change from 2019, when she joined Bradley Cooper, who directed and starred with Gaga in “A Star is Born,” for a dreamy interpretation of “Shallow” on the Oscars stage.
