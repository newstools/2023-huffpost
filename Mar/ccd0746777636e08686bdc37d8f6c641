Whether your pet had an accident on the carpet or your morning coffee ended up splashed across your white T-shirt, having an effective stain remover in your arsenal of cleaning supplies is a must. “Effective” is the key word here, because not every product out there delivers, especially when it comes to more stubborn stains like blood, grease or red wine. In order to settle the matter once and for all, we turned to the reliable online testimonials from reviewers who swear by the upcoming selection of stain removers for all your mess-related needs. Find products like an all-natural and multi-purpose stain stick, a pack of “stomp pads” that magically lift messes without any scrubbing or a no-rinse spray that extracts stubborn spots from upholstery.
