When a Coway air purifier is on sale, you want to act fast to grab one at a discounted price. Right now, you can get the popular Coway Airmega 1512HH air purifier for up to 29% off on Amazon. Unlike many bulky (and downright hideous) home appliances, the polished design of this device will actually make you want to show it off. It comes in black, white and a luxurious black and gold WiFi-enabled option, and could easily become your favorite machine-turned-home decor. The black and white models have a powerful four-stage filtration process to capture tiny particles, including pollen and other allergens, and harmful volatile organic compounds (like airborne gases from your gas stove), while the black and gold model has a three-stage filtration and is controlled by a mobile app and voice control.
