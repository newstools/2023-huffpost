Santos didn’t quite answer. “I’ll tell you where it didn’t come from: It didn’t come from China, Ukraine or Burisma, how about that,” Santos said, taking a dig at Joe Biden’s son Hunter, who was once on the board of Ukraine’s Burisma energy company. “That’s great,” Kimmel replied. “So where did it come from?” Gaetz didn’t push back on Santos’ non-answers.
