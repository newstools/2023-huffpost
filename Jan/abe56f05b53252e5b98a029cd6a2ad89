“The Daily Show” has spun Sen. Ted Cruz’s apparent hypocrisy into a game show, with his partisan takes on recent classified material news serving as the fodder. In a video released this week by the Comedy Central program, the Texas Republican is seen offering wildly different opinions when a sparkly dial strikes the names of President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence. Sensitive government documents have been discovered in the three men’s homes and other properties in the past weeks and months. On Trump, Cruz downplays last year’s FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate as a “fishing expedition.” With Biden, Cruz rants about corruption and cover-ups. As for Pence, Cruz praises him as a “good man.” The “Spin Those Docs!” send-up comes as multiple commentators point out significant differences between the Trump scandal and the situations involving Biden and Pence.
