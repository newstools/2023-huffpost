Actor Jason Momoa proclaimed that he’ll “always be Aquaman” amid changes in the DC Extended Universe as he teased his potential to play other superhero characters. Momoa expressed his commitment to his character during an interview for Variety at Sundance Film Festival on Friday. The DC film world under DC Studios’ new heads has led to changes, including the end of Henry Cavill’s Superman and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s “Black Adam.” “I’ll always be Aquaman, Ain’t anybody coming in there and taking shit,” Momoa said. “There might be some other characters, too. I can play other things, too. I can be funny and savage and charming.” Momoa, who is set to star in “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” later this year, appears to be sticking with DC Studios films following a recent meeting with DC and Warner Bros. executives, IGN reported. Momoa had previously told ET Canada that he’s hyped to see where DC Studios’ heads James Gunn and Peter Safran take the films in the future. “One of my dreams come true will be happening under their watch, so, stay tuned,” Momoa teased last year.
