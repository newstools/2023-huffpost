TV host and former New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan appeared to rebuke fellow sports analyst Skip Bayless on Sunday over an “inhumane” take following Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin’s recent on-field cardiac arrest. Strahan’s comments during “Fox NFL Sunday” came after Bayless questioned how the NFL would approach a decision on the game in the immediate aftermath of Hamlin’s frightening collapse last week. The Fox Sports 1 analyst, who is no stranger to controversial comments, was openly criticized by “Undisputed” co-host Shannon Sharpe and mocked by Charles Barkley for the tweet. Strahan appeared to join others who slammed Bayless’ comments. “There were things done here, by someone here at this network, that were inhumane,” Strahan said. “And we sit here and talk about how good ― and I’m sorry to take it this way, this route ― but I just felt like sensible people and sensible human beings have a heart...” he added. Strahan later emphasized that attention should be shifted toward Hamlin’s recovery. You can hear more of Strahan’s comments below. Hamlin, who remains hospitalized, had his breathing tube removed and remotely communicated with fellow Buffalo Bills staff and players in recent days. He wrote in an Instagram post on Saturday that when “you put real love out into the world, it comes back to you 3x’s as much,” a nod to his #3 jersey number. “The Love has been overwhelming, but I’m thankful for every single person that prayed for me and reached out,” Hamlin wrote in his first statement since his cardiac arrest.
