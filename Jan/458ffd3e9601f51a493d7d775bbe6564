The shooting happened a few blocks away from the main stage for the Moon Pie Over Mobile festival. The event continued on with fireworks and a moon pie dropping from a downtown building at midnight to mark the start of 2023, The shooter and the person killed appeared to know each other, Mobile Police Chief Paul Prine told reporters near the scene. “It would give some comfort to all of us downtown that this was not just a random shooting,” Prine said.
