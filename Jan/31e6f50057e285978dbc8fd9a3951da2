House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Wednesday refused to rebuke first-year Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) for lying about his background to win the election. MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell explained why. It’s as simple as McCarthy desperately needing Santos’ vote to pass bills on the House floor, said O’Donnell. Not that any of the “reckless legislation” passed by the GOP’s razor-thin majority will actually end up as law, the “Last Word” host noted. McCarthy, ducking a condemnation of Santos, said “the voters made the decision and (Santos) has a right to serve.” “If there is something that rises to the occasion that he did something wrong, then we’ll deal with that at that time,” the speaker added. Santos’ lies unraveled after a New York Times investigation last month. He’s now facing an investigation into his campaign contributions, and his local Long Island Republican leaders have called for his resignation. McCarthy, said O’Donnell, has shown himself as a “circus master” of House Republicans who have “no interest” or capacity to govern. The “GOP is now the Santos party,” he added. Watch the video:
