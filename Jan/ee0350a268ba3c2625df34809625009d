Rep. Matt Gaetz threatened to quit Congress Thursday if House Republicans make a deal with Democrats to elect a GOP speaker ― and his critics were hilariously eager for him to make good on that pledge. (Watch the video below.) Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked Gaetz, one of the far-right holdouts blocking Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s election through 11 ballots, if he would be “OK” with a bipartisan deal with moderate Democrats to break the impasse. Gaetz said there was no way that would happen, because Democrats would not break ranks from voting for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). To prove his certainty, he declared: “If Democrats join up to elect a moderate Republican, I will resign from the House of Representatives.” A theme emerged in Twitter users’ responses. “Promises, promises,” one wrote. “We can only hope,” wrote another.
