Coffee is great, but I prefer the extra oomph of flavor and smooth texture of espresso (which isn’t the same as “regular” coffee, by the way). If you’re also partial to espresso or espresso-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos, and think that making it at home is too difficult or expensive, think again. While you can spend hundreds, even thousands of dollars, on a fancy espresso machine, there are more affordable options on the market that also get the job done. And Target is a great place to find them. Here are eight top-rated Target espresso machines to check out, several of which cost less than $100. HuffPost receives a share from retailers on this page.
