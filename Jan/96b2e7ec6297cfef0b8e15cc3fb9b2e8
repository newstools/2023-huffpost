The bros on the “Saturday Night Live” version of “Fox Sports” just wanted to talk football in a post-game cold open after the actual NFC division face-off between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. (The Eagles won, 38-7.) But Bowen Yang got right down to raking serial liar New York GOP Rep. George Santos — in drag. Yang, first in a sweater, sports jacket and glasses reporting from the field, announced he’s “proud to be the first African American quarterback to ever dunk a football” — just one of his fabulist gridiron accomplishments. One thing he hasn’t done is “do drag in Brazil under the name Kitara Ravache,” he insisted — even though Kitara is “very, very good at it and won many, many pageants,” he emphasized. Then Yang’s Santos popped up in a shoulder-baring red dress, dark hair down. “I’m Kitara Ravache!” Yang declared, and announced his “real stats” — death drops, 26; duck walks, 19; wigs snatched, “infinity,” and an “award for tightest tuck.” Reality nearly met comedy earlier in the day when the real Santos, responding to another question about his alleged days in drag, said he was just having “fun at a festival.” “No, I was not a drag queen in Brazil, guys,” he told reporters Saturday at LaGuardia Airport, CNN reported. “I was young and I had fun at a festival. Sue me for having a life.” Check out Yang’s “Saturday Night Live” version of Santos here:
