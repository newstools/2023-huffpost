Billy Joel honored the late guitar legend Jeff Beck with two musical tributes during his Madison Square Garden show on Friday. Joel, who described Beck’s death as “the end of an era” on Twitter, told the New York City crowd that he “always loved” Beck, the guitarist of The Yardbirds who died on Tuesday after contracting bacterial meningitis. He was 78. “He was the best,” said the “Piano Man” singer. He said he “couldn’t let the night go by without doing something by Jeff.” He broke into a rendition of “People Get Ready,” a Curtis Mayfield-written song that Beck and Rod Stewart covered in 1985. Joel and his band later performed the Alabama State Troupers’ “Going Down,” a song that The Jeff Beck Group covered in 1972. Watch below beginning at the 6:18 mark.
