Wanda Sykes isn’t a fan of Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), but she can certainly get behind Kitara Ravache. The “Daily Show” guest host on Tuesday joined the comedy pile-on of the serially dishonest lawmaker, pointing to one of the latest revelations in the mountain of fabrications that have come to light since his November election. “It’s been a bad week for George Santos,” Sykes said. “Or, as he calls it, a good week.” A Brazilian drag performer recently told journalists that Santos used to perform in Brazil as a drag queen with the stage name Kitara Ravache. Multiple pictures and videos have surfaced appearing to show Santos in drag. When questioned about it by reporters at a New York airport over the weekend, Santos insisted he had never been a drag queen but appeared to confirm he’d dressed as one. “I was young and I had fun at a festival. Sue me for having a life,” he said. Sykes was baffled. “Sue me for having a life? No man, we should sue you for lying,” she said. “You know, but the drag queen part is pretty cool. I like Kitara. Kitara, you stay. George Santos? Sashay away.” Watch below on “The Daily Show.”
