While few fashion feelings are as euphoric as lacing up a new pair of sneakers for the first time, certain special occasions call for footwear that’s a bit more sophisticated. And for men, that comes in the form of an elegant dress shoe. Whether you’re heading to brunch at a flashy restaurant, attending a wedding or upgrading your office wardrobe, dress shoes are the accompaniments you need to complete your formal outfits. Oxfords, derbies and loafers fall under this classic shoe category, timeless styles that are ideal for everyday users and frequent event-goers alike. David Komisarchik, a New York-based fashion and lifestyle content creator, told HuffPost that dress shoes are an important part of any wardrobe because of their versatility. “The beauty of dress shoes is that they don’t have to be confined to formal or office wear,” he said. “They elevate casual outfits and can even bring unique details to them as well. Most of the time, if you’re unsure of what footwear to choose, a black or brown dress shoe will work.” To help you put your best foot forward, we asked Komisarchik and other stylish influencers and enthusiasts to share their go-to dress shoes.
