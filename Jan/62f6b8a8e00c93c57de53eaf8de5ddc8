“The Daily Show” is back with its first guest host Leslie Jones and she isn’t holding back. In a teaser skit for Tuesday’s episode, the “Saturday Night Live” alum was quizzed by “The Daily Show” correspondent Roy Wood Jr. on a bunch of “white folks in politics” that she’d need to know for her hosting gig. They started with a picture of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. ″Oh god. Death. A melting candle. Someone that is dying right in front of me,” Jones said. “That’s actually correct,” Wood Jr. said. “Also Mitch McConnell.” Next up, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.). “She looks like she speaks to the manager a lot,” Jones said. Jones is the first in a lineup of weekly guest hosts for the Comedy Central show, following the departure of former host Trevor Noah in December. The network said it won’t name a new permanent host until fall. Check out the bit below.
