Former Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin ripped Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) over his “sad” scroll-length list of lies during a Fox Business interview on Wednesday. Santos, who was assigned to two House committees this week, has been under fire for his pack of lies about his background. He refuses to bow to calls for his resignation. Zeldin, who — like Santos — is a Long Island Republican, received a $25,000 donation to his unsuccessful campaign for governor from Santos. Santos’ past support, however, didn’t stop Zeldin, who left Congress this month, from roasting the embattled first-termer. “And he did in fact win that Medal of Honor back in Vietnam, too. This is sad,” said Zeldin after host Lisa “Kennedy” Montgomery ticked off Santos’ “web of lies.” “From what I’m hearing, there’s even more people upset and outraged who support him than the people who had voted against him, and it’s certainly very genuine,” Zeldin said. “He’s going to have an extremely difficult time, not just in Washington, D.C, ... but especially back home, where there’s just cratering support by the day.” H/T Mediaite
