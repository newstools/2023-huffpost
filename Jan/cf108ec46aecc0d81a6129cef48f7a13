CNN made at least one major change to its New Year’s Eve coverage, banning its hosts from drinking alcohol on-air, a practice that led to some viral moments as previous celebrations went a little off the rails. The network tried to make up for it with a different kind of on-air drinking game for New York hosts Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen. They were given alcohol-free mystery shots and asked to guess what it was ― and the answers had Cooper, Cohen and viewers alike all gagging. In the video above, the two sampled pickle juice. Below, they knock back shots of buttermilk: “Socks? Shoes?” Cooper guessed after trying apple cider vinegar. “I need tequila,” Cohen cried out: Prior to the show, Cohen vowed to make it fun despite the booze ban. “We aren’t drinking, but we’re going to have a BLAST,” he told Page Six. His reaction on-air suggests some parts of the show might have been less of a blast than others.
