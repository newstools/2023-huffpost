What is it about Anthropologie that is so enduring? The retailer’s effortlessly classic pieces are elegant and timeless while also feeling fresh, modern and eclectic. It’s the perfect one-stop shop for all things home, beauty and style. That said, many of their beautifully crafted items come at a higher price point, making them cost-prohibitive for many, myself included. This is why I love to scour the boho retailer’s sale section. Without fail, I find it chock-full of gorgeous garments that will add a bit of pizzazz to even the dullest winter wardrobe. I love a major sales event, but I can always count on the Anthro sale section year-round. Below, I’ve rounded up my favorite warm winter tops currently on sale at Anthropologie. They include soft sweaters, office attire, going-out tops and everyday turtlenecks. Best of all, you get free shipping on orders over $50.
