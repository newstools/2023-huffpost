A HuffPost Slack channel recently lit up over the topic of Legos. Writers, editors and operations associates agreed: Adult Legos are a thing, and they’re really frickin’ cool. These aren’t the pirate ships or Disney playhouse sets of your childhood. They’re mini typewriters, 90s-era sitcom sets and even model versions of high-maintenance plants. Some of these sets are so good they may even convert non-Lego people. “I have never cared about Legos — not as a five-year-old and certainly not now, in my 40s — but when I spotted this Lego orchid in the window of my neighborhood toy shop, I was strangely drawn to it,” said Noah Michelson, editorial director for HuffPost Personal. “Every time we passed the store over the past three months, I made my boyfriend stop to look at the orchid again.” Michelson, who received the orchid set as a Christmas gift, is excited about the building process and the final product. “We’ve set aside an upcoming Sunday afternoon to put it together while watching a B-list horror movie, and I’ve already picked out the perfect spot for it on a sunny windowsill in my living room,” he said. “Legos — they build relationships too!” If you’re looking for a unique Valentine’s Day gift, a fun item to go on your desk or just an activity to help pass the winter hours, we think you’ll be as obsessed with these adult-approved Lego sets as we are.
