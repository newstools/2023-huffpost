Pokémon’s official TikTok account wasn’t rated “E for everyone” after it shared a since-deleted clip that would make Pikachu drop its jaw. The TikTok, which featured a Pikachu mascot clapping hands with a Lucario mascot, used a sound that featured several uses of a not-safe-for-work word. The TikTok used an expletive-filled version of the song “If You’re Happy and You Know It,” which was originally shared to the platform by Andy Arthur Smith. The Pokémon account later took down the TikTok, but a recording of it is still alive on Twitter. The TikTok was enough for Pokémon fans to mock the apparent mistake as one user noted that Pikachu has “gone rogue” following Ash’s recently announced conclusion on the series.
