Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who recently used hip-hop icon Dr. Dre’s song “Still D.R.E.” in a video, appears to be over using the artist’s music after his lawyer sent her a cease-and-desist letter this week, TMZ reported on Wednesday. Greene, who slammed Dr. Dre’s music in response to news about the letter, used the artist’s 1999 song in a Twitter video meant to recognize House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who was elected speaker after 15 rounds of voting last week. But the Republican appears to musically be onto the next episode as Stefan Passantino — an attorney from former President Donald Trump’s White House — wrote in a letter that Greene’s legal team got the message from Dr. Dre. “On behalf of Congresswoman Greene, please be advised that no further use of [Dr. Dre’s] copyright will be made by a political committee or via social media outlet she controls,” the letter said. TMZ previously reported that Dr. Dre’s lawyer, Howard King, wrote in the cease-and-desist letter that the artist would never give Greene permission “to broadcast or disseminate any of his music.” “I don’t license my music to politicians, especially someone as divisive and hateful as this one,” Dr. Dre said in a message to TMZ. Greene is known for her far-right, extremist politics and promotion of QAnon and other conspiracy theories. She was a speaker at a white nationalist conference hosted by a Holocaust denier last year.
