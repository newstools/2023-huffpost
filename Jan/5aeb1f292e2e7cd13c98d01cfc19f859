Comedian D.L. Hughley jumped into the guest host chair for Monday’s episode of “The Daily Show” and immediately tackled the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols by police in Memphis, Tennessee.

There’s something about them that looks fast-arrest-worthy,” he joked as images of the men, who are all Black, appeared on screen. “I can’t put my finger on it, but I want to arrest them myself,” he added.
