Jimmy Fallon returned to mocking scandal-hit Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) on Monday’s broadcast of “The Tonight Show.” Fallon imagined Santos’ tribute to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on MLK Day. The late night host set up the gag with tributes to the late civil rights leader from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. He then suggested how he thought Santos might have honored King: “MLK and I were best friends — I’ll always remember how much of an inspiration I was to him.” Santos faces increasing calls to resign from Congress after it emerged he made up various details about his background.
