Stephen Colbert spent more than five minutes of his opening monologue on the latest revelations about Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), the lawmaker caught in so many lies that members of his own party are urging him to resign. The latest: Santos allegedly set up a fundraiser to help a homeless military veteran’s dying dog, then took the money and ran. Despite the scandal, Santos was given plum House committee assignments: small business and science. “Those two make sense,” Colbert said. “Santos said he has a degree from the Bill Nye School at the Shark Tank Academy of Business Science.” One of the GOP’s most notorious conspiracy theorists was also given a prestigious committee post. “Santos is not the only cuckoo dum-dum to snag a committee seat,” Colbert said as he pointed out that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) won a spot on the Homeland Security Committee. “She’ll finally be able to investigate the Gazpacho Police,” he cracked, referring to one of Greene’s most infamous flubs.
