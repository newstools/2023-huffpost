MSNBC’s Mehdi Hasan reminded viewers that you can’t “shame the shameless” as he called out Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for defending Mike Pence amid revelations that the former vice president kept classified documents after his time in office. (Watch a clip of Hasan’s remarks below). Hasan’s comments come after Cruz declared it’s “still early” to offer an opinion on the discovery of documents at Pence’s home. Meanwhile, Cruz called for an FBI search targeting Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden’s son. Hasan sniffed out hypocrisy from the “brazen cynic” and Texas senator, who called Pence a “good friend,” a “good man” and someone who has explained where the documents came from. “Please excuse me, Ted Cruz says, as he twists himself into an Auntie Anne’s pretzel, extra greasy,” Hasan quipped. “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: you can’t shame the shameless.”
