Jimmy Kimmel spilled on Snoop Dogg and his growing list of demands during the rapper’s appearance on his show on Thursday (Watch below.) Snoop initially kicked it with Kimmel as a co-host during the comedian’s first episode of his ABC late-night show in 2003. Kimmel, who talked with Snoop on Thursday, revealed the requests on the rapper’s hospitality rider ― a list of items a celebrity wants in their dressing room ― from 20 years ago. The comedian revealed that Snoop’s 2003 asks included chicken wings from either Hot Wings Cafe or Roscoe’s Chicken & Waffles, “any brand” of fruit punch, Country Time lemonade, Moët & Chandon champagne and Donald Duck brand orange juice. Snoop’s list of asks, Kimmel noted, has grown over the years and now includes items such as a small bag of “regular” Doritos, a small bag of “flavored” Doritos, a six-pack of cranberry juice, one gallon of Minute Maid fruit punch and one item labeled “IMPORTANT”: a bag of honey BBQ Fritos chips. “You know you’re here for an hour, right?” Kimmel asked Snoop. “You got to look at it like this, Jimmy, every opportunity to do a television show is like a shopping spree, I get a chance to get some free groceries,” Snoop joked.
