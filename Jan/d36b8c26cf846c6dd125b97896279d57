When it comes to being comfortable, few things get the job done better than quality loungewear. This is especially true if you work remotely and want to feel at least a little put together, even if you’re taking meetings from your bed or home office. After being on tons of Zoom meetings and virtual huddles, I noticed one common thing: Sweatshirts appeared to be almost everyone’s WFH uniform of choice, including mine. If you’re also a pullover connoisseur, you know that not all sweatshirts are comfortable enough to wear all day. Sometimes they can be a bit scratchy, pill after only one wear or hug every curve of your body despite claiming to be oversized. Luckily for you, however, I took the guesswork out of finding the perfect sweatshirt for your preferences and budget by asking my fellow colleagues what their favorite sweatshirt is that they can’t live without.
