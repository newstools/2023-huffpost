Mia Goth criticized the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences following the organization’s snub of her films “X” and “Pearl” as nominees at this year’s Oscars. The “Infinity Pool” star called out the academy for being “very political” in its lack of nods for her horror films ― and its snubs of other notable films in the genre ― during an interview with reporter Jake Hamilton this week. “I think that it’s very political and that it’s not entirely based on the quality of a project, per se,” Goth said. “I think there’s a lot going on there, a lot of cooks in the kitchen when it comes to nominations and categories that are recognized. Maybe I shouldn’t say that either but I think that’s true. I think a lot of people know that. I don’t know why.” Goth added that a “change is necessary” and a shift should take place for more horror films to receive recognition. “If they wanted to engage with the wider public, I think it would be of benefit, really,” she said. Goth’s flicks aren’t the only horror movies that have been passed over by the academy in recent years. Jordan Peele’s “Nope” failed to scoop up nominations this year, while other films such as “The Witch” and “Hereditary” were given zero Oscars nominations in the past. Scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis received her first Oscar nomination this year after decades in the film industry for 2022′s “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” a movie outside the horror genre. There have been exceptions, however. IndieWire noted that M. Night Shyamalan’s “The Sixth Sense” and “The Exorcist” were “one of the few” flicks from the genre to score Best Picture nominations. “The Silence of the Lambs” took home several Oscars while “Get Out” earned Peele the award for Best Original Screenplay in 2018.
