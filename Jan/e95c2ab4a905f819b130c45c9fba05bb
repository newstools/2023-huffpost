In true Hollywood fashion, the Golden Globes attempted a full-fledged comeback this year after being cast into award show exile amid troubling claims surrounding its ethical practices and diversity in its ranks. It was mostly business as usual Tuesday, with Emmy-winning comedian Jerrod Carmichael hosting the show from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The red carpet drew its anticipated gaggle of A-list stars, too, who appeared ready to enjoy the festivities. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which organizes the Golden Globes, hoped that the 80th ceremony would be a return to form after several years marred by both the COVID-19 pandemic and public criticism. In 2021, the awards faced heated backlash following a series of Los Angeles Times reports which found that the HFPA had zero Black members and had accepted lavish gifts from members of the industry who were campaigning for recognition. In response, stars and studios widely boycotted the 2022 ceremony, which NBC opted not to televise. The mounting pressure prompted the HFPA to bring in new leadership and add 21 new members, including six Black journalists, among other changes. As for the 2023 contenders, “The Banshees of Inisherin” and “Everything Everywhere All at Once” led the pack with eight and five nominations, respectively. On the television side, “Abbott Elementary” led with five nominations. Check out the list of nominees and winners below.
