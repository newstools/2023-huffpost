Comfort and sustainability is at the heart of Allbirds’ footwear. The buzzy brand gained a cult following in recent years thanks to running shoes and everyday sneakers that are as lightweight and breathable as they are supportive.  Currently, Allbirds is offering up to 40% off on select footwear, including bestsellers like their Wool Runners and Tree Runners for men and women. And it’s more than just running shoes that you can snag on sale. The brand has added tons of other eco-conscious and versatile styles to their storefront, like ballet flats, technical sneakers and even cushioned slides. Each design features some element of the brand’s core materials, such as the eucalyptus knit blend upper for an ultra-breathable wear or a water-resistant and temperature-regulating merino wool that’s perfect for all-season wear.
