If you’re looking for something romantic to watch around Valentine’s Day, Netflix has you covered. The streaming service is due to add at least 80 titles in February, including rom-coms and steamy dramas. “Your Place or Mine,” a new romantic comedy featuring Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher, will premiere on Feb. 10. And starting Feb. 14, viewers will get the chance to watch “A Sunday Affair,” a new Nigerian film about a love triangle involving two best friends. On the show side of things, Netflix will be adding new seasons of the popular psychological thriller “You” (Feb. 9), family sitcom “The Upshaws” (Feb. 16), teen drama “Outer Banks” (Feb. 23) and docuseries “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” (Feb. 24). A number of older shows and movies will also be joining the streaming service next month, including season six of “The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals” ― one of several spinoffs of the popular baking competition series. The third and fourth seasons of NBC’s medical drama “New Amsterdam” will also become available to Netflix viewers. “Lord of the Rings” fans are also in for a treat, as all three films in the trilogy are coming to the platform. And if you’re looking for an escape to Italy, you’ll be able to stream “Eat Pray Love” and “Call Me by Your Name.” Check out the full list of February movies and shows below.
