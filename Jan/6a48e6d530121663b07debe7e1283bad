Adam Kinzinger, a former House Republican who served on the Jan. 6 committee, said he asks himself “all the time” whether there’s room for him in a GOP that’s “not a party I recognize.” “I still hold the values I hold,” Kinzinger, who left office earlier this month, told “The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert on Thursday. He added: “I don’t know what my party believes anymore. I don’t hear them talking about smaller government, I don’t hear them talking about a strong national defense. I hear some of them supporting Vladimir Putin over the freedom-loving people of Ukraine and it’s not a party I recognize.” Kinzinger, who was censured by the Republican National Committee along with former House Republican Liz Cheney for sitting on the Jan. 6 committee, has previously criticized his party’s leadership. He recently called House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) a “piece of shit.” Kinzinger, who told Colbert he felt “politically homeless,” weighed in on his time on the Jan. 6 committee and said he thinks there are “pretty good odds” that the Justice Department will bring charges against former President Donald Trump. “Nobody is above the law in the United States of America, that includes the president, that’s especially the president of the United States,” Kinzinger said.
