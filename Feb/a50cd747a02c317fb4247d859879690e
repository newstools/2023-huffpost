Traveling with children isn’t the easiest task in the world, especially if they’re infants and or in the terrible twos of toddlerhood. But there’s one product that will help the experience go much more smoothly: a travel stroller. This kind of stroller is designed to be extra-light and folds up into a compact size to make it convenient to store in plane carry-on compartments, car trunks and even the overhead racks of a train. Plus, its non-bulky design makes it way easier and less of a hassle to navigate through crowded airports, transit stations and even theme parks. These strollers often have other useful features, including storage space for diapers, bottles and other small items, and an overhead canopy for sun protection. If you want to take some of the stress your next family trip, you’re in luck. We rounded up a couple of the highest-rated travel strollers you can get on Amazon.
