Actor Olivia Colman used a radio interview prank to get back at longtime friend Paul Rudd for not letting her know he was in England promoting his new Marvel movie, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Rudd was participating in a spoof advice segment — titled “Agony Ant-Man” — on BBC Radio 1′s breakfast show when Colman called in with a fake Welsh accent. “Hiya Paul, I’m a huge fan. I wanted to pick your brains,” she said. “What would you do if you had a really good mate, for over 20 years, and then this friend, he doesn’t live in England, but he’s come to England, and he hasn’t told you about it? And then not only has he not told you about it, he’s come onto a radio show?” “Oh, my God. Oh, no,” replied Rudd. “Would you be offended?” Colman continued. Rudd, seemingly now knowing who he was talking to, responded: “Personally, if it’s me, absolutely not. I tend to give everybody the benefit of the doubt.” “OK,” Colman laughed as she dropped the accent and identified herself. She then recalled how their two decades of friendship began when they appeared in the same play and Rudd would “stay on the floor of our rubbish flat.”
