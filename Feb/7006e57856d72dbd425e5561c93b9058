Fox News commentator Kennedy used a racial epithet this week to describe Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. On Friday’s broadcast of “Outnumbered,” the former MTV VJ called Buttigieg “a cracker who only wants to racially divide the country further” over his program to build racial equity into U.S. infrastructure. Watch the video here: Kennedy, whose full name is Lisa Kennedy Montgomery, has previously joked on the air about installing an “American Ninja Warrior” style obstacle course on the U.S.-Mexico border to stem migration. She has also called rock icon Bruce Springsteen “a big commie.” New York Mayor Eric Adams landed in hot water last year after footage emerged of him calling white police officers “crackers” at a 2019 event. “I definitely apologize. Inappropriate, inappropriate comments should not have been used,” he said at the time.
