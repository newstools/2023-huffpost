Jimmy Kimmel tore into Donald Trump for saying he would roll back rights for transgender people if elected president again. In a new video, Trump vowed to instruct federal agencies to end all programs promoting gender-affirming care at any age. “I will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that the only genders recognized by the United States government are male and female, and they are assigned at birth,” Trump said. Kimmel finished the thought for him: “...by me, your commander-in-chief, and official penis inspector of the United States of America.” “He’ll be grabbing everybody by the genitals ’cuz when you’re a celebrity, they let you,” he added, referring to Trump’s infamous “Access Hollywood” tapes.
