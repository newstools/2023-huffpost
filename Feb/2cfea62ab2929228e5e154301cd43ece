An Etsy designer says business is booming after one of her items was featured in an Instagram post for Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” tour earlier this week. Abby Misbin said she received 60 orders in a single day on the e-commerce platform following the appearance of her “disco ball cowboy hat” in the music icon’s post, according to a TMZ story Friday. That far surpasses the five to six orders Misbin receives in a typical week, the outlet said. Beyoncé had announced the tour Wednesday with an Instagram photo in which she rocked the sparkly hat and an equally shiny bodysuit. By Saturday morning, the post had received over 8.3 million likes. The “Renaissance” tour, the singer’s first in five years, is set to include 48 shows. Her 2022 album of the same name has earned nine Grammy nominations ahead of Sunday’s ceremony. According to a screenshot shared by TMZ, Beyoncé’s stylist had messaged Misbin last year to inquire about receiving a “fully mirrored” cowboy hat. Misbin sold the handmade item to the stylist for $215. In August, it appeared in Beyoncé’s teaser video for the song “I’m That Girl.” The popularity of the Instagram post has caused Misbin to close her shop for the time being, as she can only make about two hats a day, according to TMZ. Misbin said she’s now trying to fulfill orders with her sister’s help before she reopens her business. “Each hat takes a long time to perfect and I’d never want to compromise the quality! all customers deserve beyoncè quality!” the designer wrote on Instagram.
