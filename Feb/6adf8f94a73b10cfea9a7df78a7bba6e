JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A Mississippi college celebrated “Will Smith Day” with none other than Will Smith. The actor and entertainer visited Tougaloo College recently to speak with mass communication and performing arts students, WAPT-TV reported. The station reports that his visit was a favor to Tougaloo graduate Aunjanue Ellis, his co-star in the film “King Richard.” “Today was Will Smith Day at Tougaloo College,” Tougaloo President Carmen Walters said. “Our students were able to interact with Mr. Smith in a private setting,” Walters said. “This is the first visit of many producers who are assisting us with launching our new program in Film Making and Film Production.”
