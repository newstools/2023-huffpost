New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) on Friday predicted that the GOP would move on from former President Donald Trump. Sununu, himself a potential Republican presidential candidate, told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” there was no way Trump would be the party’s 2024 pick. “Donald Trump is not going to be the nominee,” he said to Mika Brzezinski. Sununu repeatedly insisted it was very early days in the contest, adding that the race was just “not going that way” for Trump. “We’re just going to say, ‘Thank you for your service,’ and move on,” he added, echoing comments he’s made in the past. However, when Brzezinski pressed Sununu on how he’d vote if “lightning struck twice” and Trump did secure the nomination, the governor suggested that he’d back the previously impeached GOP leader. “Of the former president and myself, one of us is a lifelong Republican and one of us will always support the Republican nominee,” he said, adding, “That’s me, Mika.” Watch the interview here:
