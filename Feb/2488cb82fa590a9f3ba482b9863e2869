Spoiler alert for “The White Lotus.” Murray Bartlett would “definitely” return to star as hotel manager Armond in a future season of “The White Lotus.” And on “The Late Show” this week, the actor navigated the tricky issue of how it could happen given that his character, well, dies at the end of Season 1.
