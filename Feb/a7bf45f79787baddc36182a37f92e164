New York Yankees legend Derek Jeter opened up this week about how a thong helped him shake off a massive hitting slump in 2004. The Baseball Hall of Famer recalled during a “True Confessions” game on “The Tonight Show” how he wore a gold thong “in front of thousands of” New Yorkers. The confession stumped host Jimmy Fallon and Rita Ora, who was playing the game with him. Jeter then opened up about a teammate ― who appears to be Jason Giambi ― who told him that a gold thong he hung in the locker room would guarantee a hit for a struggling player. “I thought the guy was crazy,” Jeter told the two. Jeter shared how the article of clothing, which was reportedly a “gold lamé thong with a flame-line waistband,” got him out of his 0-for-32 hitting slump when he hit a first-pitch homer against the Oakland A’s in April 2004. “It’s rough when you’re going through it, but you’re the only one that can get yourself out of it,” said Jeter about the slump after the game. Jeter told the New York Daily News at the time that the thong made it “so uncomfortable running around the bases.” You can see their reactions to Jeter’s story below.
