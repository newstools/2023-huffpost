If there’s something the editors at HuffPost love to gab about, it’s all our most recent and beloved purchases. Nothing gets us going quite like sharing the items that have most delighted us in recent weeks, from major home splurges and skin care staples to new clothing and more utilitarian items. This month, we’ve acquired all manner of objects, all of which were purchased after careful consideration and comparison — it’s a habit that comes with the job! Below, we’ve assembled a comprehensive list of everything our editors shopped throughout the month of February. Our roundup runs the gamut from Rihanna’s blotting powder and a Supergoop dupe to colorful cord organizers and more than one type of dry shampoo. Give it a look and pick up a few of these tried-and-tested must-have products across all categories. HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.
