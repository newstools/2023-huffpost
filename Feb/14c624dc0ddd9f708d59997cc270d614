HuffPost staffers recently got to chatting about their favorite unisex travel backpacks. Some like a compact pack intended for a laptop and wallet. Some crave complex luggage full of pockets and sections. Some want a roomy knapsack that fits a suitcase’s worth of clothes. All want a versatile, long-lasting bag that will make traveling just a little bit easier. Unlike tote bags, duffles or suitcases, backpacks don’t have to be dragged or rolled. Many fit airport carry-on restrictions and will allow you to navigate hands-free through airports, trains and terminals. To help you find your perfect travel bag, we’ve rounded up some favorites from our own team plus top-selling rucksacks with rave reviews and a few high-capacity backpacks that were previously recommended to HuffPost by devoted practitioners of packing light. Ahead, you’ll find bags at a variety of different budgets and sizes — yet all are high-quality, durable travel backpacks with receipts to prove it.
