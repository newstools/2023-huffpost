“The Daily Show” guest host D.L. Hughley on Wednesday made a joke about Vice President Kamala Harris’ historic attendance at the funeral of Tyre Nichols, a Black man who died last month after being beaten by police in Memphis, Tennessee. It was the “very first time a president or vice president had attended the funeral of a Black person that was slain by the police,” Hughley noted. “I’m happy she showed up in Black-mode and not in cop-mode. I mean, she was a district attorney and that could have been a sting operation,” the comedian joked, referencing Harris’ time as district attorney of San Francisco. “Seriously, there is a good reason to have a Black vice president,” he added. “If you’re not going to do anything about police reform, at least you can have somebody who goes to those funerals.” “Wow,” responded one member of the audience.
