Peter Wehner, a former senior aide to President George W. Bush, warned in a new essay that it’s “unwise” to write off far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) as “an outcast, a fringe figure, deranged but isolated.” Greene is now “a confidante” of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Wehner noted in a column for The Atlantic. And the extremist Republican’s call this week for a “national divorce” is “giving voice to a widespread and growing sentiment” in the GOP, he added. “MAGA Republicans like Marjorie Taylor Greene have added calls for secession to their corrosive lies about the 2020 presidential election,” Wehner wrote. “More incendiary and treacherous claims will follow.” “Greene and McCarthy — one crazed, the other cowardly — embody a large swath of the modern-day GOP,” Wehner concluded. “Any party that makes room for seditionists and secessionists is sick and dangerous.” Read Wehner’s full essay here.
