Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce’s wife, who is 38 weeks pregnant, said the Super Bowl could play a role in naming the couple’s baby as the Eagles face off against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. Kylie Kelce, whose husband is facing her brother-in-law Travis Kelce in the big game, described herself as feeling “very pregnant” in an interview with People. She said her husband has joked that the Super Bowl could influence how the couple names their baby and teased that it could also allude to the game in a less-than-subtle fashion. “We don’t have a name, but my husband keeps making the joke that if she does come while we’re out there that we’ll name her Super, which is one of the most absurd things I’ve ever heard of in life,” Kelce told People. “We have talked about if she does come out there that we might consider making her initials S.B., or something related to the Super Bowl, just as sort of a tribute.” The 29-year-old mother of two said she plans to bring not one but two obstetricians along with her to Arizona. “They’re both my OBs on a regular basis, but I didn’t necessarily want one to be by themselves. All hands on deck,” Kelce said. She said her due date, which People did not give, “lines up very well” with the day of the Super Bowl this year. Kelce wouldn’t be the first wife of an NFL player to give birth on Super Bowl Sunday. Los Angeles Rams receiver Van Jefferson learned that his wife, Samaria Jefferson, was giving birth to their second son after his team’s Super Bowl victory last year. Samaria Jefferson was carted out of the game on a stretcher, and video shot after the game showed her husband rushing out of the stadium to see his newborn child. The couple named their son Champ Curtis.
