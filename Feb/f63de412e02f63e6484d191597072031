The trailer for the latest installment in the Fast & Furious films has dropped and naturally, the word “family” features prominently. It’s uttered three times in the first minute of the trailer for “Fast X” and twice more after that as Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and... y’know... his family take on new heavy Dante (Jason Momoa) and his crew. The packed cast includes returning characters Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Jakob (John Cena), Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Cipher (Charlize Theron), Tej (Ludacris) and Han (Sung Kang) as well as new characters Abuela Toretto (Rita Moreno) and Tess (Brie Larson), among many many (many) others. “Fast X,” the penultimate chapter in the series, hits screens May 19.
