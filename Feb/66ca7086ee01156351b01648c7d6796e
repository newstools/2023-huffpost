While spring will presumably be here any second now, you might find yourself needing a little retail therapy to ride out of the rest of winter — and because you may have earmarked the bulk of your budget for that upcoming summer vacation, we’ve rounded up a small collection of highly affordable “why not” purchases from our favorite reasonably-priced retailer, Walmart. While the goods ahead are inexpensive, they’re also fun, entertaining, and products you might actually enjoy using. (If they’re not right for you, they may also be the perfect thing for that person in your life who could use a little pick-me-up.) Ahead, check out some unique and mood-boosting buys that might just put a little, well, spring in your step until the real thing has arrived.
