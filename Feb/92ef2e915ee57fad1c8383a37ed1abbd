Lizzo says she lost track of award categories as she got “so drunk” with Adele during Sunday’s Grammys. The “About Damn Time” singer, who won the Record of the Year award, opened up Friday on the Elvis Duran and the Morning Show about spending time with Adele as the two attended the ceremony. “I legitimately was so drunk. Me and Adele were drinking so much that we didn’t even really know what the categories were at this point,” Lizzo said. “We were like, ‘Wait, did they do Best New Artist?’ We didn’t even know. And then when it was time and they would call our names, we would just be like, ‘Smile, smile.’” She also shared that she took a flask of tequila to the event, as well as one with white wine for her friend. “I brought it for Adele and then I drank hers,” Lizzo said. Lizzo, who noted that Adele was looking forward to sitting with her in the days before the ceremony, said she was “in total shock” after winning Record of the Year. “I didn’t expect to win at all, let alone a big one. That’s a big award to win,” she said. Her victory marked the first time that a Black woman won for Record of the Year since Whitney Houston snagged the honor for “I Will Always Love You” in 1994. Lizzo thanked Beyoncé in a heartfelt acceptance speech Sunday. “You sang that gospel medley and the way you made me feel, I was like, ‘I want to make people feel this way with my music,’” she said, referring to a Destiny’s Child performance. “So, thank you so much. You clearly are the artist of our lives.”
