Our faces are changing, and so should the products we use on them,” Garrison said. Whether you’re feeling insecure about the appearance of a new wrinkle or volume loss in your cheeks, Natalie Setareh, a cosmetics instructor with a belief that makeup can be for everyone, said that makeup can also be a tool to help you feel more confident. “I’m near 40 and I’m already using makeup to give me a more youthful appearance. It’s natural to want to do this,” she said. Setareh said makeup is often just a play on light, and her techniques involve bringing focus to your favorite features using highlighting, while helping to downplay anything that makes you feel self-conscious.
