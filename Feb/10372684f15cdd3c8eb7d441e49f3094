I don’t know about you, but anytime I’m tasked with buying a gift for someone in my life, I inevitably end up getting a little treat for myself as well. It doesn’t matter if it’s a birthday or holiday gift, I simply can’t resist — and that includes Valentine’s Day shopping. Even if you’re a bit of a cynic, being single on Valentine’s Day can be demoralizing, which is why it’s a great excuse to take some time out for indulgent self-care and to do a bit of shopping. This Valentine’s Day, treat yourself to something special and get a hit of that much-needed shopping serotonin. Below, I’ve rounded up some of the best Valentine’s Day gifts for men and women. The list includes everything from beauty goodies to cozy home decor, comfy jammies and a few tech upgrades. Single or not, there’s nothing like a little treat to perk us up and help get us all through the bleak mid-winter. Why wait around for someone else to get you a present?
