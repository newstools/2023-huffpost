Donald Trump being called a “pussy ass bitch” is now permanently in the Congressional Record, and Seth Meyers can’t help but giggle that it’s entirely the former president’s own fault. The phrase was uttered during a House Oversight Committee hearing Wednesday over what GOP members allege is Twitter’s left-leaning bias in its censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story. Highlighting Republican hypocrisy, Democrats asked a former Twitter executive, Anika Collier Navaroli, about a 2019 incident involving the Trump White House’s attempt to persuade Twitter to take down a disparaging tweet from model Chrissy Teigen. Navaroli read Teigen’s tweet verbatim into the record: “Excuse my language, this is a direct quote, but Chrissy Teigen referred to Donald Trump as a ‘pussy ass bitch.’” “I do enjoy that Donald Trump being called a pussy ass bitch is now an official part of the Congressional Record, and only because he complained about it,” Meyers quipped Thursday on “Late Night.” Watch below.
