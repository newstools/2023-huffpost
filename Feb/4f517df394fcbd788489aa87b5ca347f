Fans expressed shock and dismay after Aaron Carter was left out of the Grammy Awards “In Memoriam” tribute on Sunday night, just three months after the singer’s death. The moving tribute segment honored country singer Loretta Lynn, Fleetwood Mac’s Christine McVie, actor and rapper Coolio, guitarist Jeff Beck and slain Migos member Takeoff. Additional names of other significant music industry members who recently died also flashed on the screen, as performers paid tribute to the late entertainers. Carter, who was 34 when he died, shot to fame at a young age with hits like “Aaron’s Party (Come Get It)” and “I Want Candy.” He was found dead at his home in Lancaster, California, in November 2022. While the late singer was not honored during the on-air tribute on Sunday night, Carter was included in the in memoriam tribute section in the official program book for the show, which you can view here (Carter is listed on page 191). He was also listed on the award show’s in memoriam page on its website. A source close to the Grammys told HuffPost on Monday that “there are hundreds of names to consider and it’s always a tough call for the people who put the show together.” HuffPost reached out to a representative for Carter for comment. In addition to Carter’s notable omission, the tribute missed Gangsta Boo, the Three 6 Mafia member who died on Jan. 1. It also skipped over rapper Lil Keed, who died on May 13. Watchful Grammy viewers also cried foul when it appeared that Taylor Hawkins, drummer for the Foo Fighters, was also left out of the tribute. Hawkins died in March 2022 at age 50, while the band was on tour in South America, and just days before they were scheduled to perform at the 2022 Grammy Awards. The drummer was honored by host Trevor Noah at last year’s Grammy Awards, which is why he was not included in this year’s segment. At last year’s ceremony, the Foo Fighters took home three Grammys for Best Rock Album, Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song.
