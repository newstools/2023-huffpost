The 54th NAACP Image Awards kicked off in front of a live audience for the first time in three years. The two-hour special, hosted by Queen Latifah, aired live on BET on Saturday night from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, California. The show hasn’t had a live audience since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Last year’s show was partially virtual with a few live appearances from presenters, award winners and honorees, such as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Several winners in a number of categories for this year’s show had been announced in non-televised events leading up to Saturday. Beyoncé’s album “Renaissance” got the recognition it was owed by winning the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Album on Monday night. The album shockingly lost the Album of the Year award to Harry Styles’ “Harry’s House” at the Grammys earlier this month. The 2023 NAACP Image Awards also honored Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade, recipients of the President’s Award. Other special honorees included Serena Williams, who was honored with the Jackie Robinson Sports Award. Comedian Kevin Fredericks won the Outstanding Social Media Personality award on Friday. The 2023 Entertainer of the Year nominees are Angela Bassett, Mary J. Blige, Quinta Brunson, Viola Davis and Zendaya. The award is voted on by the general public.
