Tim Miller, a onetime Republican National Committee spokesperson, on Tuesday suggested Nikki Haley’s video announcing her 2024 run for president was indicative of one particular hurdle she will face on the campaign trail. Haley is “looked at skeptically by the MAGA voter” because of her flip-flopping on Donald Trump, Miller noted on MSNBC’s “Deadline: White House.” And the former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations “doesn’t even know what her own message is,” added Miller, who pointed to this video as proof: Haley’s first sentence was “about how she grew up in this city in South Carolina that is divided by a railroad track that divides the city by Black and white, divides the city by race,” Miller pointed out. “And then five seconds later into the video, she attacks the 1619 Project and the George Floyd protests and people who said that racism is a structural problem,” he continued. “How can the video be both about how you grew up in a structurally racist town and also making fun of people who say racism is a structural problem?” Miller asked. “She’s trying to have it both ways. She’s trying to be the MAGA nationalist and also the uniter,” he said. “And anyone that’s trying to have it both ways gets struck in the middle of the road without anybody supporting her and I think that’s where she’s at right now.”
