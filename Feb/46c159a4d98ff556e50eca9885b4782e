The odd trio from “Only Murders in the Building” kicked off the Screen Actors Guild Awards true to style. Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez filmed a kooky skit that aired at the start of the ceremony. In the sketch, Martin tried to break off his decades-long friendship with his fellow comedy great, in a clear ode to Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson’s film, “The Banshees of Inisherin.” “But we’ve been best friends ― well, pretend show business friends ― for years. There’s no one I feel fake closer to!” Short insisted, as the trio threw around a few feckin’ words that got a laugh out of the audience. Fortunately, Gomez was on hand to break up the faux beef between the comedy greats, who are both nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series for their roles in the hit whodunnit. “Hey guys, it’s okay,” Gomez interrupted. “You both obviously are going to lose.” Check it out below: Carly Koltes contributed to this report.
