It’s time to drain your savings and forgo rent because Beyoncé has announced her 2023 world tour to support her Grammy-nominated album “Renaissance.” Queen Bey kicked off Black History Month on Wednesday by letting the masses know on Instagram that lucky fans in Europe and North America will be able to experience her 2022 album — which has become their daily soundtrack — live. Beyoncé will kick off the tour in Stockholm in May. She will perform a mix of stadium and arena shows across Europe through June 27 before picking up in North America in Toronto on July 8, per her website. And if those in America feel a bit salty about having to wait longer than their European counterparts, don’t fret too much. Beyoncé is doing a large stretch of shows across the states during Virgo season — including concerts in California, Las Vegas and Seattle — in order for fans in those cities to get the full “Virgo’s Groove” experience. Bey’s announcement comes just days before the 2023 Grammys, making some speculate that she will perform at the awards ceremony, Variety noted. So, fans who are strapped for cash: Don’t go selling your organs yet. You might see her perform live for free this Sunday.
