Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel on Friday tore into four House Republicans who are backing legislation to make the AR-15 rifle the “national gun of the United States.” Rep. Barry Moore (R-Ala.) last week introduced the bill, which is co-sponsored by serial fabulist Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.), Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) and extremist Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.). “These are the heroes working to get us a national gun,” said Kimmel on his show, “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” “And the next time there’s a mass shooting with an AR-15, which will probably be by the end of the week, we will know who to thank: the four gun whores of the apocalypse.” Watch the video here:
