Reality star heiress Paris Hilton said despite her status as a “sex symbol,” she thought of herself as asexual before meeting her husband. Hilton was linked to the likes of Benji Madden, Nick Carter and Adrian Grenier, got engaged multiple times and made a distributed sex tape with Rick Salomon that she said was intended for personal use only. But her tabloid-reported escapades didn’t truly represent what was going on in her private life, she told Harper’s Bazaar in an interview posted Thursday. “I was known as a sex symbol, but anything sexual terrified me,” she said. “I called myself the ‘kissing bandit’ because I only liked to make out. A lot of my relationships didn’t work out because of that.” That all changed with her trust of Carter Reum, whom she married in 2021, she said. “It wasn’t until Carter that I finally am not that way,” Hilton told the magazine. “I enjoy hooking up with my husband.” Hilton might find that new parenthood ― she and Reum welcomed a baby boy last month via a surrogate ― doesn’t exactly turbocharge life in the bedroom. Still, “The Simple Life” and “Paris in Love” star told Harper’s: “I just feel like after all the hell I’ve been through, I’m finally getting what I deserve, which is someone I can trust and someone to build a real life with.”
