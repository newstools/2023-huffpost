“You” is the most popular show on Netflix, according to the streaming service’s public ranking system.

Starring Penn Badgley, “You” follows a serial killer named Joe Goldberg as his toxic obsession with certain women takes him on a violent journey across the globe. The second most popular show of the moment is “Full Swing.” Produced by the company behind “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” in collaboration with the PGA Tour, the new Netflix docuseries gives viewers a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the lives of professional golfers. Looking down the ranking, there are a number of other reality-based shows from the streaming service. “Perfect Match” is new dating series hosted by Nick Lachey (sans wife Vanessa, who apparently decided to sit this one out after co-hosting “Love Is Blind” and “The Ultimatum” with him).
