Jamie Lee Curtis and Michelle Yeoh’s friendship created yet another viral moment at Sunday’s Screen Actors Guild Awards. The “Everything Everywhere All at Once” cast went wild as Curtis was announced as the winner for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture for her role in the multiverse epic. Stephanie Hsu, who was also nominated in the category, screamed and leapt to her feet as her co-star’s name was called in an upset over the favorite, Angela Bassett. Yeoh embraced Curtis, who gave her co-star a massive kiss before heading to the stage. At last month’s Golden Globes, Curtis went viral for her jubilant reaction to Yeoh’s win for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Curtis has been Yeoh’s biggest cheerleader throughout the awards season and even started a chant of her friend’s name during Sunday’s acceptance speech. Yeoh is nominated for best actress at the ceremony. “Michelle Yeoh, I love you, I love you, I love you!” she said as a tearful Yeoh watched on from the audience. It was Curtis’ first time winning a SAG Award. She was nominated once before in 1995 for her performance in “True Lies.” “I know you look at me and think ‘Nepo baby,’” she said during her acceptance speech. “But the truth of the matter is that I’m 64 years old and this is just amazing.” Curtis is also nominated for an Oscar for the first time this year.
