For her latest “Foxsplains” segment on “The Daily Show,” correspondent Desi Lydic went to town on Fox News’ coverage of the suspected Chinese spy balloon that was shot down off the South Carolina coast over the weekend.

What if it was full of COVID, or worse, critical race theory?” And: “Hold on a second, Biden shot the balloon down over the ocean — where Osama bin Laden lives?” Watch the video here:
