Serial liar Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) tried to mock Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Twitter on Thursday — but it did not go well. Santos criticized Ocasio-Cortez’s impassioned speech on the House floor attacking the House GOP’s vote to remove Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) from her Foreign Affairs Committee assignment. “I DEMAND Sandy get an Oscar, PRONTO!” tweeted Santos. “I’ll talk to the Academy about getting you a lifetime achievement award for Best Actor,” actor Billy Baldwin responded. Other critics couldn’t believe the gall of Santos accusing someone else of playing a role, given that he’s been found to have fabricated much of his back story and is under investigation for his campaign finances.
