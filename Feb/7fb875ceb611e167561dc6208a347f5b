There is research that suggests weighted blankets can be more than just a cozy addition to a sleep routine. According to one review of studies, they have therapeutic potential for reducing anxiety in some people.  If you’ve never experienced the gentle and calming pressure of a weighted blanket for yourself, especially since many options can cost well into the hundreds, now is your chance to get one on sale for over 77% off! Luna, a weighted blanket and bedding brand, is a top seller at Amazon and crafts their blankets using sustainable and 100% Oeko-Tex certified materials like bamboo cotton. Oeko-Tex is a standard that ensures textiles are free from harmful substances and produced in a way that’s better for the environment.  Luna says their selection of machine-washable blankets feature non-shifting woven glass beads, and they offer a variety of weights (from five to 30 pounds), sizes and materials, including sherpa fleece for people who like things warm.
