Keke Palmer has a new job title: Mommy. The star of “Nope” and the host of “Password” announced on Instagram Monday that she and her boyfriend, Darius Jackson, have welcomed a baby boy, Leodis Andrellton Jackson. Palmer’s Instagram announcement featured photos of the new parents looking frazzled but happy while she sings “Someone” by El DeBarge, a song featured on a mix tape Jackson made for her, she explained. She also noted that Leo was “born during Black History Month, with a name to match!” Palmer memorably announced she was having a baby while hosting “Saturday Night Live” in December. “People have been in my comments saying, ‘Keke’s having a baby, Keke’s pregnant,’ and I want to set the record straight ― I AM!” she gushed while pulling open her jacket and revealing her stomach. Late last month, she casually announced she was having a son during an appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”
