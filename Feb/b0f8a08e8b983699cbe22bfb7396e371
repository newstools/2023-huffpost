I’ve long been of the belief that if you have one or two really high-quality serums doing a lot of heavy lifting, you don’t need to jam-pack your skin care routine with a ton of different steps.

They’re known to properly address things like dark spots, melasma, acne, fine lines, wrinkles and dryness. Below, I’ve rounded up 13 super effective and deliciously luxurious serums recommended by both dermatologists and reviewers. They include splurge-y products from high-end brands along with more accessible serums with lower price points.
