Former “Grey’s Anatomy” regular Jesse Williams revealed that people thought he “knew about medicine” because of his role as Dr. Jackson Avery in the hit TV series. Williams, who last appeared as a main cast member on the show in 2021, told “The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert that people would direct their attention to him on planes when someone needed medical attention. “It’s odd and I’ve said this before, but I’ve been on a plane two different times when they have said ‘Is there a doctor on board? Somebody needs it’ and they look at me,” Williams said. “And I say ’The one thing you know about me for sure is I’m not a doctor.′” Williams also told Colbert about filming the upcoming third season of “Only Murders in the Building,” the Golden Globe-nominated series in which he’s reportedly set to play a documentarian. Williams, who said he was in “awe” of both Steve Martin and Martin Short, said his first day on set included Meryl Streep, Paul Rudd and Selena Gomez. “It’s great to learn and completely fumble, but I’m learning and trying to play around with some of the comedy stuff, being a little lighter,” Williams said. “It’s a little more my natural disposition.”
