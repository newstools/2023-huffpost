Twitter users mocked House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for giving them “Ben Affleck at the Grammys” vibes during President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address. Affleck became a meme during Sunday night’s music awards ceremony after he was caught on camera looking a bit, well, disinterested alongside wife Jennifer Lopez. On Tuesday night, it was McCarthy’s turn to cut a bored figure as he sat with Vice President Kamala Harris behind Biden. Tweeters lightheartedly suggested McCarthy had usurped Affleck as the king of “uncomfortable.”
