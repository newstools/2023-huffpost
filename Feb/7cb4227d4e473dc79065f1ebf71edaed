Good news for comedy fans with a Netflix subscription! The streaming service is due to add nearly 100 titles in March, including a number of fresh comedy specials and funny movies. Nearly one year after the infamous Oscars slap moment, comedian Chris Rock is taking the stage on March 4 for the platform’s very first live-streamed event, “Chris Rock: Selective Outrage.” Comedian Mae Martin ― whom you might recognize from HBO’s “The Flight Attendant” or the Netflix series “Feel Good” ― is also releasing a stand-up special in March. Directed by Abbi Jacobson, “Mae Martin: SAP” will premiere on March 28. On the rom-com side of things, “Murder Mystery 2” is set to be released on Netflix on March 31. A sequel to 2019’s “Murder Mystery,” the movie reunites Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston as an ordinary couple who find themselves caught up in a thrilling investigation. Not everything joining Netflix in March is a comedy, however. Three highly anticipated documentaries set to debut include “MH370: The Plane That Disappeared” (March 8), “Waco: American Apocalypse” (March 22), and “Money Shot: The Pornhub Story” (March 15). The back half of Season 4 of the psychological thriller “You” will be available on March 9. And fans of “The Last of Us” who have a hankering for more zombie-related content might want to tune in to the 2013 movie “World War Z,” which hits the streaming service on March 7. If you can’t get enough of “Love Is Blind,” you won’t have to wait much longer for Season 4, which is out on March 24. Netflix is also adding a lot of fitness content on March 10, including a collection of 10-, 20- and 30-minute workouts. Check out the full list of March movies and shows below.
