Basketballer Dwyane Wade yelled at singer Janelle Monáe as she appeared to get confused in the middle of the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in Salt Lake City on Friday. Monáe was part of a winning effort as Wade’s team — coached by two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo — narrowly beat Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith’s team, coached by WNBA great Lisa Leslie. Team Dwyane, however, dealt with a challenging moment when Monáe seemingly lost track of who had possession. Wade hollered that their team was “on offense.” During a break, Wade reminded the “Glass Onion” star of where to score. But the multitalented entertainer still struggled at times in the game. “I tried,” said Monáe as she rocked sunglasses and made her way to the bench with a smile. The singer, who teased that she received help from basketball comic Cream E. Biggums prior to the game, was one of a number of stars who played in the annual event. It also featured a deep “4-point shot” from “Shang-Chi” star Simu Liu, a shoddy shot attempt from “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” personality Guillermo Rodriguez, and a half-court make from WWE star The Miz that almost tied the game before the buzzer.
