Comic/actor Sarah Silverman kicked off her week as guest host of “The Daily Show” by showing off some of her bona fides.

Then she guessed why they might feel so strongly. “What am I, a gender-neutral bathroom over here? What am I, a Starbucks cup that just says ‘happy holidays’ over here? What am I, a grown woman with an opinion?” she asked, then realized it was the last one. “Oh, yeah, that’s probably it.” See her full Monday night monologue below:
